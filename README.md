# 🧾 Pokémon  – Interactive Web App

## Overview
This project is an **interactive Pokémon Pokedex web application** built with Streamlit.\
It allows users to **search, filter, compare, and analyze Pokémon data** in a user-friendly interface.\
The app is designed for both casual Pokémon fans and data enthusiasts, providing insights through visualizations and comparisons.\
It also showcases how Python can be used for **data handling, visualization, and web deployment**.

## Scope:
This project focuses on Python-based exploratory data analysis and interactive visualization. Predictive modeling is intentionally out of scope.
